# GeekNFT

First, here's the link to the live version:
[Geek NFT landing page](https://geeknft.netlify.app)

This is my first project using ReactJs. The design was gotten from Dribble. I used things like ```useContext``` to manage and share states between components. I also used ```react-chartjs-2``` package which uses ```ChartJs``` under the hood for the charts. It was a fun experience and I hope to continue learning more. The design might not be exact, but it's close. The design can be found below:
